            <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) has proven to be a powerful tool in addressing complex challenges across a broad
spectrum of field. The AIE 2025 Symposium is set to convene researchers from diverse backgrounds, spanning
fundamental AI research and various engineering disciplines including but not limited to Cybersecurity, Urban
Science, Robotics, Water and Environment, Materials, Bioinnovation, Resilient Systems, Quantum Computing,
Wireless Communications, and Renewable Energy. This symposium is dedicated to discussing, exploring, and
advancing the use of Artificial Intelligence to tackle challenges within these pivotal engineering research areas.
Scheduled for February 12-13, 2025, the event seeks to foster interdisciplinary collaboration, drive innovation, and
facilitate the sharing of insights on AI's role in propelling engineering forward.
            </p>
            <p>
              In light of the identified gaps, the aim of the AIE 2025 Symposium is recalibrated to serve as a
pivotal bridge connecting the realms of artificial intelligence research with practical engineering applications.
Scheduled for early February 2025, this symposium is dedicated to unveiling the vast potential of AI in addressing
complex engineering challenges across various domains, including cybersecurity, urban science, robotics, and
renewable energy, among others. By fostering an environment of interdisciplinary dialogue, AIE 2025 seeks to
enhance the awareness among AI researchers of the impactful applications of their work in engineering, equip
engineers with a deeper understanding of AI's foundational advancements, and encourage a collaborative exchange
of ideas and solutions across multiple engineering disciplines. The event aims to catalyze innovation, drive
technological advancement, and facilitate a comprehensive sharing of insights, ultimately propelling engineering
forward through the strategic application of artificial intelligence.
              </p>
            <p>The International Symposium on Artificial Intelligence for Engineering Innovations (AIE 2025) is strategically
crafted to connect the forefront of AI research with its practical implementation in various engineering fields. Set for
early February 2025, AIE 2025 strives to merge AI developments with engineering challenges, encouraging
innovation, cross-disciplinary cooperation, and the sharing of knowledge. This event is dedicated to showcasing AI's
powerful applications in engineering, raising AI researchers' awareness of their impact on engineering progress, and
providing engineers with an understanding of AI's core technologies. AIE 2025 will bring together experts from
academia, the industry, and government to discuss important issues, research directions, and AI's wide-ranging
applications in engineering. Attendees will present new research, exchange ideas, and discuss recent advancements
across numerous topics,

The lab’s research is focused on modeling fracture and multi-physical response of manmade and natural materials across spatial and temporal scales. Mobasher’s research contributes to the development of a wide range of numerical models to address the needs for non-linear modeling of materials subjected to mechanical and multi-physical loading scenarios. More recently, the CSM lab’s research scope was expanded to explore the integration between the Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) approaches along with well-established computational methods such as Finite Element Method (FEM). The outcomes of this research support various engineering applications including Infrastructure Integrity and Resilience, Energy, Automotive and Aerospace applications. Mobasher is also a Co-PI and the leader of the Energy Research Theme for Sand Hazards and Opportunities for Resilience, Energy, and Sustainability (SHORES), one of the NYUAD Research Institute Centers.
